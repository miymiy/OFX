# Notes

So here it is :) Thanks for reading and testing

## Todos

1. Error feedback improvements: the error feedbacks can be better (should be!). Initially I only had the red outlines on text boxes but at the very end of this project I decided to add a message box to display detailed reasons. It's incomplete and rough but I do want to leave it in to show the idea
2. Styling can be centralised: I used bootstrap to give myself a quick start. There are custom css and styles in quite a few places. They should be tidied up.
3. Accessibility
4. Tests (of course!)
5. Import with absolute path, eg as discussed [here](https://gist.github.com/branneman/8048520)
6. Cannot think of more component refactors for now (YAGNI trumps DRY) but there may be more when I come back to look at this again.
7. Supported browser testing: this is only tested in Chrome & Firefox
